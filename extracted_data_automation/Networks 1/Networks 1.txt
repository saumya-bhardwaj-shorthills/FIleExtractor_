2. WIRELESS OR UNGUIDED COMMUNICATION CHANNEL
TYPES OF NETWORK
		A computer network means a group of ‘network’ Computers  
                           
	A network can mean a small of linked computers to a chain of a few hundred computer of different  types      (eg , PCs, minis, mainframes etc ) Spread around the world.                                        

TYPES OF NETWORK
		Based on network span or geographical spread , network can be divided into two types:
TYPES OF NETWORK BASED ON GEOGRAPHICAL SPREAD
 (I)LAN (LOCAL AREA NETWORK)
(II)WAN(WIDE AREA NETWORK)
LAN(LOCAL AREA NETWORK)
TYPES OF NETWORK BASED ON GEOGRAPHICAL SPREAD
 	Small computer network that are confined to a      localised are a  ( eg ; an office , a building or a factory)  are known as LAN’s.
The key purpose of LAN is to serve its users in resource sharing .
The hardware as well as software resources are shared through LAN’s.
LAN users can share data , information , programs , printers , modems ,etc., 
LAN (LOCAL AREA NETWORK)
WAN (WIDE AREA NETWORK)
TYPES OF NETWORK BASED ON GEOGRAPHICAL SPREAD
	The network spread across countries (or) on a very big geographical area are known as WAN‘s.
It is a group of computers that are separated by a large distance and tied together .
It can be a group of LAN’s that are separated across several locations and connected together to look like one big LAN.
Computers are connected to a wide area network are often connected through public networks such as telephone systems .
WAN (WIDE AREA NETWORK)

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAN & WAN 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAN & WAN 
S.NO	LAN	WAN
1)	IT IS SPRED OVER A SMALL AREA	IT IS SPREAD OVER A VERY LARGE AREA
2)	IT IS USUALLY COSTS LESS TO SET IT UP	IT COSTS  HIGHER TO SET IT UP
3)	IT IS USUALLY A SINGLE NETWORK	IT IS USUALLY A NETWORK OF MANY NETWORK
TYPES OF NETWORK BY COMPONENTS
		Another parameter based on which you can classify networks is the role played by network computers in the network operations on basis , there are 2 types of networks:
TYPES OF NETWORK BY COMPONENTS
(I)  PEER TO PEER NETWORKS
II) CLIENT / SERVER NETWORKS
PEER TO PEER (P2P) NETWORKS
TYPES OF NETWORK BY COMPONENTS
PEER TO PEER (P2P) NETWORKS
		P2P network literally implements the meaning word Peer (ex : Each computer on P2P network is equal) , that is each computer can play a role of a client or a server.
		
		The computer that serve on P2P computers are often termed as non-dedicated servers 
                                                              Contd….
PEER TO PEER (P2P) NETWORKS
(P2P) networks are popular as home networks and for use in small companies as  they are inexpensive and easy to install ,but they are limited scope and are difficult to secure.
On small networks , workstation that can double up as a server is known as 
    NON-DEDICATDED SERVER .
Non–Dedicated Server can shuttle b\w client as well as server role.
Small networks that are using such a servers are known as P2P networks.                               
PEER TO PEER (P2P) NETWORKS
CLIENT / SERVER NETWORKS
TYPES OF NETWORK BY COMPONENTS
CLIENT / SERVER NETWORKS
Unlike P2P networks , bigger networks prefer to have  centralised control .
They do this by clearing designations servers and clients such networks are called 
    CLIENT-SERVER NETWORKS (or) 
    MASTER-SLAVE NETWORKS.
On bigger network installation , there is a computer reserved for the server’s job and its only job is to help workstations access the data, software , hardware resources .                                       CONTD…
CLIENT / SERVER NETWORKS
It does not double up as workstation and such servers is known as dedicated servers.
Dedicated servers operates solely as a server on a network.
For ex : There may be a server exclusively for serving files – related requests like storing files  deciding about their access privileges & regulating the amount of space allowed for each server.
CLIENT / SERVER NETWORKS
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLIENT SERVER AND P2P
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLIENT SERVER AND P2P
SERVICE	CLIENT SERVER	P2P
SECURITY	The server controls security of network	No central control over security
MANAGEMENT	The server manages the network .
Needs a  dedicated team of people to manage the server .	No central  control over the network .
Any one can set up.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLIENT SERVER AND P2P
SERVICE	CLIENT SERVER	P2P
DEPENDENCY	Clients are depend on the servers.	Clients are not depend on central
servers.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLIENT SERVER AND P2P
SERVICE	CLIENT SERVER	P2P
PERFORMANCE	The server can be upgraded to be made more powerful to cope with high demand.	If machines  on the network are slow they will slow down other machines.
BACKUPS	Data is all  backed  up on the main server .	Each computer has to be backed up Data can easily be deleted by users .
		Computer networks are formed when computers are connected with one and other . The connections among the hosts are established using specific communication media.
		The computer networks can be categorized as these:
TYPES OF NETWORK BASED ON COMMUNICATION CHANNEL
1.	WIRED COMPUTER NETWORKS
2.	WIRELESS COMPUTER NETWORKS
1.	WIRED COMPUTER NETWORK 
TYPES OF NETWORK BASED ON COMMUNICATION CHANNEL
		As clear by name in wired computer networks , the host and other devices are interconnected through wiring or cables. Most wired computer networks are of LAN type .
		
		Although , there are wireless LAN’s too and there are bigger networks that used wireless medias too.

Contd..
WIRED COMPUTER NETWORK 
		
		Commonly used cables in wired networks are one of the following three types:
WIRED COMPUTER NETWORK

NETWORK DEVICES AND HARDWARE
		In the smooth functioning of a computer , other than computers and wiring , many devices (or) specialized hardware play important roles .
NETWORK DEVICES AND HARDWARE
NETWORK INTERFACE CARD (NIC)
A standalone computer (a computer that does not attached to a network) lives in its own world and carries out its tasks with its own inbuilt resources.
The (NIC) is a device that is attached to each of the workstations and the server & helps the workstation to establish all the important connections with network.
Each NIC that is attached to a workstation has a unique number identification which is known as note address
                                                                      	      Contd…
NETWORK INTERFACE CARD (NIC)
The NIC is also called as Terminal Access Point (TAP) different manufacturers have different name for the interface .
The NIC is also called as NIU – (Network Interface Unit)
The (NIC) manufacturers assigns a unique physical address to each NIC-card , this physical address is know as MAC-address   ------ (Media Access Control)
NETWORK INTERFACE CARD (NIC)
MAC ADDRESS
The (NIC) manufacture assigns a unique physical address to each NIC-card , the physical address is know as (MAC-Address) .
A MAC-Address is a 6-bytes with each byte separated by an colon 
          Eg;
                      10 : B5 : 03 : 63 : 2E : FC 
Contd..     
MAC ADDRESS
MAC-address is actually an number assigned to the network card of your computer .
The first three bytes are “manufacturer—ID” and the last three byte are  the card—no .
Eg;                  Manufacturer--ID

                       10 : B5 : 03 : 63 : 2E : FC
                                                                        
                                                  Card-no                                        


MAC ADDRESS
WI-FI CARD
It’s either an internal (or) external local area network adapter with a built-in wireless radio and antenna.
Most common WI-FI cards used in desktop computers are PCI express WI-FI cards made to fit the PCI express cards slots on the mother board .
The primary benefit of using a WI-FI card in desktop computer is that it allows you to set-up your workstation (or) home office without considering the proximity (or) availability of hard line network access
WI-FI CARD
SWITCH
A switch is a device that is used to segment networks into different subnetworks called subnet or LAN Segment.
Segmenting the network into smaller subnet, prevents traffic overload in a network.
A switch is responsible for filtering (or) transforming data in a specific way and forwarding packets between LAN segment.


SWITCH
Contd…
A switch can support any packet of protocol.
LAN’s that are segmented through switches are called as switched LANs.
SWITCH
BRIDGE
A bridge is a device that let’s you link networks together.
Bridges are smart enough to know which computers are on which side of the bridge, so they only allow those messages that need to get other side to cross the bridge.
Bridges can handle networks that follow same protocol.
Contd..
BRIDGE
BRIDGE
ROUTER
A device that works like a bridge but can handle different protocol is know as Router.

A Router is a network device that forwards data from one network to another network.

A router works like a bridge but can handle different protocols.
ROUTER
If the destination is unknow to a router it sends the traffic to another router (using logical address) which knows the destination, Based on a network road map called as (Routing Table).

Routers can help to ensure that packets are travelling the most efficient paths to their destination.

ROUTER
GATEWAY
A gateway is a  network device that connects dissimilar networks.
It establishes an intelligent connection between a local network and external network with completely different structures 
Gateway is actually a node on a network that server as an entrance to another network.
In enterprises the gateway is the computer that routes the traffic from workstation to a out side network that serving the web pages.
GATEWAY
ACCESS POINT(AP) / WIRELESS ACCESS POINTS
An     ACCESS POINT-(AP) ,        also      called     as  (Wireless access point) WAP
WAP is a hardware device that establishes connections of computer devices on wireless LAN with a fixed wire network.
AP is a station that transmits and receives data
AP has a range of (up to 150 feet for home based APs).
Wireless routers can function as(AP) , but not all (AP)can work as routers.
ACCESS POINT(AP)
THE CLOUDS
A cloud is a generic term used for “INTERNET”.
Cloud computing is internet-based computing whereby shared resources, software , and information are provided to computer and other devices are in demand, like electricity grid.
