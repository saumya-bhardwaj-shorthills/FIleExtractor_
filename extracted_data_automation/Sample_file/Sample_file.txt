Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting insights and knowledge from structured 
and unstructured data. It combines techniques from statistics, mathematics, and computer science to analyze 
data and draw meaningful conclusions. A s organizations increasingly rely on data -driven decision -making, 
the demand for skilled data scientists has surged. Data Science encompasses various processes, including data 
collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization, allowing busines ses to make informed decisions 
and identify trends.  
 
 
 
 
 
Python has emerged as one of the leading programming languages in the field of Data Science due to its 
simplicity, versatility, and a rich ecosystem of libraries. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib 
provide powerful tools for data manipulation,  numerical analysis, and visualization.  
 
 
Here are some of the essential libraries in Python that are widely used in Data Science, along with their 
purposes and typical usage scenarios.  
 
Library  Purpose  Usage  
Pandas  Data manipulation 
and analysis  DataFrame operations, data cleaning, and 
analysis  
NumPy  Numerical 
computations  Array operations, mathematical functions, 
linear algebra  
Matplotlib  Data visualization  Creating static, animated, and interactive plots  
Seaborn  Statistical data 
visualization  Enhanced visualizations based on Matplotlib
